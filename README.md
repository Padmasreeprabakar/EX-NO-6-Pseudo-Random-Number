# EX-NO-6-Pseudo-Random-Number

# AIM: 
Implementation of Pseudorandom Number Generation Using Standard library

# ALGORITHM:
Start the program and import the required libraries.

Seed the random number generator using the current time(i.e) rand(time(0));

Get the number of randon number to generate.

Pass the value for number of iterations and print the numbers.

End the program.

# PROGRAM:
```
import random
num1 = random.randint(1, 100)
print("Random Integer between 1 and 100:", num1)
num2 = random.random()
print("Random Float between 0 and 1:", num2)
num3 = random.uniform(10, 50)
print("Random Float between 10 and 50:", num3)
```
